      <description>After arriving at CCA a few weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;m starting on a project with Adrian Price-Whelan and David W. Hogg. We are trying to figure out how to answer the question: What does it mean that APOGEE doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a bunch of binary systems containing black holes? Barring the obvious reason that APOGEE&amp;rsquo;s targets are low-ish mass stars and thus unlikely to be companions to BHs and their high-mass progenitors, we think it will be interesting to compare a bunch of synthetic binary populations generated with COSMIC to Adrian&amp;rsquo;s close binary catalog.</description>
