      <description>This week, Rodrigo and I have been working on using our knowledge on removing instrument systematics from Kepler to better understand how to remove instrument systematics from HST. In my research I use HSTâ€™s Wide Field Camera 3 to observe transiting exoplanets in the infrared, and use the spectrum to try to identify water in the upper atmospheres of planets. This is a tall order, seeing as the signals we are looking for are &amp;lt;200ppm, and the instrument systematics can easily introduce correlated noise at the 0.</description>
