      <description>The sites of star formation are self-gravitating, supersonic, magnetized turbulent clouds. These clouds are riddled with small-scale structure - clumps, filaments, and shocks - which undoubtedly play a role in how stars form. To understand these structures a bit better, my collaborator Nia Imara (Harvard) and I have been thinking about statistics we might use to characterize them!
Inspired by the Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich approximation, used to describe structure formation in cosmology as a succession of gravitational collapse into sheets, filaments, and halos or clusters, we&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the following space.</description>
