<p>Hello again, world! We (the data group) have been slightly deliquent with this blog lately, but our collective New Year&rsquo;s Resolution is to post more. <em>(Not really, I just made that up. But here&rsquo;s hoping!)</em> This particular post is going to be fairly meta, because coming back to the blog after a break seems like a natural opportunity to reflect a bit.</p>
<p>In the last couple of months we made some changes to the format of our weekly group meetings. Figuring out how to run a good meeting is a hard job, especially when the goal of your meeting is measured less in productivity and more in culture. We want the group meeting to feel like a community event where everyone has an equal opportunity to get the feedback and support they want, and there&rsquo;s no atmosphere of judgement or power hierarchy. In my experience, all the other good stuff <em>(lively science discussions, new ideas, increased understanding of other group members&rsquo; research)</em> arises naturally under those conditions. This is a hard thing to control, and it&rsquo;s gotten trickier as our group has gotten bigger! Recently we had to move to a bigger room, and the usual &ldquo;60 or 90 minutes divided by number of people in the room&rdquo; time allotment was leaving many people without enough time to get the feedback they wanted from the group.</p>
<p>Our new group meeting format is similar to the old one in that everyone gets a chance to share something <em>(a figure, an idea, a piece of text, etc)</em>, but we made a few tweaks. We are now using Google Slides, which is an improvement because <em>(a.)</em> it cuts down dramatically on the time spent fumbling with HDMI and AirPlay when everything can be shown from one laptop, and <em>(b.)</em> each meeting leaves a record, which is nice to reflect on sometimes and allows group members who aren&rsquo;t at the meeting to see what happened. We are also shifting away from the requirement that every group member should attend and present at every meeting; this hasn&rsquo;t really changed attendence in practice, but I think it helps the general tone when we all know that everyone in the room is there because they <em>want</em> to be. Finally, regardless of how many people attend, each person gets 10 minutes to speak. If we run out of time, those who didn&rsquo;t get a chance to show their slide get bumped to the beginning of next meeting&rsquo;s slide deck. Overall this format seems to be working well, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll continue to experiment.</p>
<p>All that being said, here&rsquo;s my slide from last week&rsquo;s meeting! I wanted to spark a discussion on data visualization and particularly the representation of uncertainties, with the example of an exoplanet mass-radius diagram that I drafted up for a paper. Mass-radius diagrams are tricky because the objects that naturally take up the most ink and catch the viewer&rsquo;s eye are the most uncertain measurements, which actually contain the least information. So how to make sure that the viewer gets a quick, intuitive sense of what we really know about exoplanet properties? My favorite example of this in the literature <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03550">from Zach Berta-Thompson&rsquo;s 2015 paper</a> is shown on the left. He scales the opacity of the points with their relative uncertainties, which is a clever way around this problem. I actually liked this plot so much that I made <a href="https://bedell.space/dataviz/mr.html">an interactive version of it in Bokeh</a> for fun a while back! On the right is my mock-up of more of a &ldquo;contour plot&rdquo; approach, which solves my pet peeve of having disembodied error bars creeping in at the edges of the plot, and I think conveys the uncertainties better. I like that the overlapping transparent shapes give more weighting to the regions of parameter space that are covered by more planets, and I think this is a good way to go when what I&rsquo;m trying to convey is more about the <em>population</em> than about individual planets. Next step is to scale ellipse transparencies with their areas!</p>
