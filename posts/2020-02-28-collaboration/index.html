  <div class="post">
    <p>Inspired by a conversation with Andy Casey who we visited at Monash University
in Melbourne last week, I decided to write a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWaVOINUsdvUmcnNl0NWxpiJTcLDVmh2V80ni4o6AaE/edit?usp=sharing">Collaboration
Policy</a>, and share my feelings on the topic at our weekly group meeting.</p>
<p>At Monash, Andy showed me the <a href="http://astrowizici.st/research/expectations/">Research Expectations</a> page of his website,
which is a document outlining the expectations he has for his students, and
what their expectations might be for him.
I love this idea and would like to create my <em>own</em> research expectations
guidelines for any students working with me, current or future.
As I started to write it however, I realized I wanted to write a zeroth-order
expectations document first.
Something a little more general, targeted at everyone I work with: a
collaboration policy.</p>
<p>My collaboration policy document states what expectations I have for
co-authors on my papers, and what they should expect from me as a co-author on
their papers.
It describes how I select and order co-authors, how I like the commenting and
feedback procedure to go, etc.</p>
<p>The document also outlines an explicit policy for <em>proposal</em>, as well as
paper, collaboration, including my definition of the responsibilities of
funded and unfunded collaborators.
This is something that I have found particularly difficult to navigate in the
past, because proposal authorship and responsibility distribution can be
delicate and political.
I found it really helpful to make my expectations explicit and I&rsquo;m sure it
will help avoid a few awkward conversations in future.</p>
<p>Finally I outline my philosophy on authorship.
For example, I feel strongly that &ldquo;whomever does the work leads the paper&rdquo;, a
policy that may seem obvious but still, sadly, has to be made explicit on
occasion.</p>
<p>This is just a first version, and there&rsquo;s a lot more I&rsquo;d like to add.
The Astro Data group were enthusiastic about working on a collaboration policy
together, and I think we&rsquo;ll converge on an official version soon.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed writing this document.
I&rsquo;ll  find it useful to send to my collaborators, but I also enjoyed
solidifying some of my feelings and opinions on this topic.
I recommend that everyone goes through this exercise!</p>
