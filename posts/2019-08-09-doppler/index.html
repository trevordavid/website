<p>I&rsquo;m generally interested in the problem of mapping the surfaces of stars
and exoplanets, and while I&rsquo;ve focused so far on doing this using
photometric timeseries, for the past couple months I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with
spectroscopic data and the idea of Doppler imaging. The basic idea here is to
take high resolution spectra of a rapidly rotating star at different
rotational phases and look at the distortion of its spectral lines as
starspots rotate from the blueshifted hemisphere to the redshifted hemisphere.
One of the seminal papers on this method is
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...321..496V">Vogt et al. 1987</a>,
who did an experiment where they ``painted&rsquo;&rsquo; the letters <strong>VOGT</strong> on the
surface of a star, generated a bunch of synthetic spectra, and attempted
to recover the stellar surface map from that dataset. The authors devised
a method that successfully recovered the <strong>VOGT</strong> pattern, and this has
since been adapted and applied to dozens of real systems, often quite
successfully.</p>
<p>However, the techniques employed in Doppler imaging are often computationally
expensive, as they require running radiative transfer models in thousands
of discrete cells on the surface of the star, then numerically integrating
the specific intensity to arrive at a model for the observed spectrum. Most
studies therefore focus primarily on <em>optimization</em>: given a fiducial set of
stellar parameters (such as inclination, angular velocity, differential
rotation parameter, etc.), the goal is to find the single surface map that
best matches the observed spectrum, usually via a non-linear optimizer and
using priors that make convergence fast. While this works well, it can
mask the great degree of uncertainty inherent to the problem, hide the
various degeneracies at play, and introduce biases due to the fact that
parameter like the stellar inclination are rarely known precisely.</p>
<p>To improve on this, I&rsquo;ve been working on extending my <strong>starry</strong> code
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157...64L">Luger et al. 2019</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rodluger/starry">github.com/rodluger/starry</a>) to
work with spectra by expanding the wavelength-dependent stellar surface map
in spherical harmonics. I worked out some cool analytic results that allow
me to not only compute a model for the spectrum analytically, but also to
<em>invert</em> the problem and quickly solve for both the maximum likelihood
surface map <em>and</em> its uncertainty. The figure above shows a test of my
code on the classic <strong>VOGT</strong> star. The 16 epochs of data are shown on the
left, next to the phases of the star seen by the observer. The input map
is shown at the top right, with the inferred map below it, and the
intensity uncertainty at the bottom.</p>
